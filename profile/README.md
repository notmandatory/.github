## Hey there 👋

Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) is a suite of software libraries that allows you to build secure, feature-rich, and cross-platform Bitcoin wallets.

Most of the BDK projects are based on the powerful [`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and [`rust-miniscript`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) libraries.

The home page for the overarching BDK project and the BDK Foundation that supports it is [bitcoindevkit.org](https://bitcoindevkit.org/).

### Project Tiers

We provide the technical infrastructure to maintain a number of software and documentation projects across different maturity levels and support models. To help you navigate these projects, we've categorized them along two dimensions: Maturity Level (Stable or Experimental) and Support Model (Foundation or Community). See "The Book of BDK" [chapter on library tiers](https://bookofbdk.com/getting-started/tiers/#library-tiers) for more details.

The lead and secondary maintainers for each project are responsible for:

  - triaging new issues and PRs
  - providing guidance to contributors
  - reviewing and merging changes based on rough consensus
  - making and publishing releases
